# An Artist of Life

## A philosopher
*"Empty your mind,be formless,shapeless,like water.Now you put water into a cup,it becomes the cup.You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle.You put it into a teapot it becomes the teapot.Now,water can flow,or it can crash.Be water,my friend."*

    if not success:
      print("Ignoring empty camera frame.")
      # If loading a video, use 'break' instead of 'continue'.

    # the BGR image to RGB.

### Steps to creat pixel art

- Explore how to make pixel art.
The art style of Final Fantasy and Super Mario World inspired a new generation to create retro digital art. Pixel artists draw on the past to create new visions and even make their own games.

- Cool pixel art of outer space planets and sky.
How do you start drawing pixel art?
The visual style of the Atari 2600, Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and early computer graphics influenced — and continue to influence — millions of creative minds. Pixel art draws on that influence and nostalgia. Modern graphical resolution is better than anything earlier gaming systems offered, but the particular aesthetics and emotional association of the pixelated style still have appeal.

 

- To make pixel art you have to:     

       

    1. Understand that pixels — tiny squares of a single color — can make up a larger image. This is the first essential step to drawing pixel art.

    2. Decide on what resolution you want to emulate. Are you inspired by 8-bit graphics? 16-bit graphics? Determine what style you’re working with ahead of time, as it will affect how you approach each subject.

    3. Determine a size for your pixels. The smaller the pixel, the more potential for intricate detail.

    4. Choose a color palette. Most pixel art uses fewer colors than modern high-resolution graphics to mimic the limited palette of old games that relied on juxtaposing two colors to give the impression of a third.

    5. Create a grid and start placing pixels.
